# Utilities
Written (or compiled from other authors) by a C# developer living in a VB6 and VB.NET world who just needs to stretch his mind a little from time to time.

The code in these Utilities is designed to be generally useful, but is not actually used in any production system. 
Rather, it is an exercise in understanding more about the .NET libraries that are used so often without a care as to whether "importing" or "using" another library is necessary for the given project.

The ultimate goal is to build a set of utilities that are used often in .NET programming, but written in a lower-level language like C++ to try and improve the performance.
